print("- Problem: Many IDs are skipped/missing in WealthX")
print("- Result: Stopped at ID 420,000 but only had ~311K actual records")

print("- Target: 2.5 million actual database records")
print("- Approach: Scan IDs continuously until target DB count reached")
print("- Smart stopping: Uses consecutive empty batches to detect end")
print("- Result: Will collect 2-2.5M actual records regardless of ID gaps")

print("\nðŸŽ¯ Current Status:")
print("- Database Records: 312,418")
print("- Target Records: 2,500,000")
print("- Completion: 12.50%")

print("\nðŸ”„ How it works now:")
print("1. Continues scanning WealthX IDs starting from 422,375")
print("2. Collects all valid records found (skips gaps automatically)")
